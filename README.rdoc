== README

I've created this Rails 4 (Ruby 2.0.0p247) app using the Chinook database (chinookdatabase.codeplex.com). 

The migration and seed file will get you up and running.

The main goal of this project is to use it as a jumping off point to learn front-end frameworks, i.e. Knockout and Angular and become more famailiar with Rails overall.

All the MVC code was generated from scaffolds.

== TODOs

* Add data entry validations
* Create tests
